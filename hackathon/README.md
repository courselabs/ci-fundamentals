# Hackathon!

The hackathon is your chance to spend some decent time modelling and building a CI/CD pipeline of your own.

You'll use all the key skills you've learned in the course, and:

- ðŸ˜£ you will get stuck
- ðŸ’¥ you will have errors and broken apps
- ðŸ“‘ you will need to research and troubleshoot

**That's why the hackathon is so useful!** 

It will help you understand which areas you're comfortable with and where you need to spend some more time.

And it will give you a pipeline that you built yourself, which you can use as a reference for the future.

> â„¹ There are several parts to the hackathon - you're not expected to complete them all. Just get as far as you can in the time, it's all great experience.
